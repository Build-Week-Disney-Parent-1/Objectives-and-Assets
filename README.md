## PITCH
As a parent with small children, wouldn't you like to make your Disney Experience more fun and economical?  Disney Parent puts the tools in your hands to be able to swap childcare and stroller passes with other parents allowing you save money and enjoy the 'big-kid' rides.

## MVP
1. An on-boarding process for parents.
 2. "Mock" (no real data will be used/transmitted) on-boarding process for a "fully licensed independent childcare contractor" (think Uber for short term childcare.) Nearby users of this type can be "contracted" by parents if no parents are nearby and available/willing to swap passes. 
 3. Ability to easily create and post a request (including meeting place/ride and time, and number of kids you have)
 4. Ability to easily edit / delete a question
 5. Ability for anyone to easily search / find posted requests (filter by time, location, general search)
 6. Ability for a second parent user to log in and respond to the request
## STRETCH
#### DS:
1. Use a notification API like Twilio (https://www.twilio.com/) or Growl (http://growl.info/) for notifications when your request has been answered, or when new requests are posted.
2. Gamify the app so the Parents that swap their pass the most are ranked at the top a leaderboard.
3. UX: Collaborate on a portion or all of a Web MVP with any Web teammate. For example: File structuring, Git, Styles, Semantic elements, etc. Learn something new and practice cross-collaborating.
4. UX: UX: Write a blog post in medium about your visual design decisions for this project; share the link in your Google Doc.
