  - It allows parents to go on rides that they normally wouldn't be able to use while other parents watch their childred/strollers
  - Helps parents to save money?
  - No reliable way to verify that "babysitters" are reliable / validation process
- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
  - "babysitters" are reliable / validation process via "fully licensed independent childcare contractor license"
  - Save money on "stroller parking" by sharing parking spots with other parents
- What is the mission statement?
  - As a parent with small children, wouldn't you like to make your Disney Experience more fun and economical? Disney Parent puts the tools in your hands to be able to swap childcare and stroller passes with other parents allowing you save money and enjoy the 'big-kid' rides.
